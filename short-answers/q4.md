# Question
Consider this `Animal` class. In the `getOwners` method, why should we not return `this.#owners`? Why do we instead return `[...this.#owners]`?

```js
class Animal {
  #owners = []

  constructor(breed, sound) {
    this.breed = breed;
    this.sound = sound;
  }
  addOwner(owner) {
    this.#owners.push(owner)
  }
  getOwners() {
    return [...this.#owners]
  }
  makeSound() {
    console.log(this.sound);
  }
}
```
