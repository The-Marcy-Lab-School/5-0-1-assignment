# Question
Consider this code:

```js
const greeting = 'hello';
console.log(greeting.charAt(0));
```

We know that the way we access properties and methods on objects is via dot notation. Here we're calling `charAt` directly on the string `hello`. So my question is this:

**Are primitive values *actually* objects? Why are we able to call methods on primitive values?**
