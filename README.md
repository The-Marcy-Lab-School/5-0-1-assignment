## Before you start
OK, so *now* it's finally time to use the new `class` syntax! But as you use it, don't forget the underlying structure of the prototype. You should still think about the instances vs the constructor function that makes them.

# Question 1 - Circle

Create a class `Circle`. Each instance should have the following properties:
- `radius`
- `color`

Each instance should have the following methods:
- `getArea`
- `getCircumference`
- `draw`
- `changeColor`

# Question 2 - BankAccount
Create a class `BankAccount`. Check out the tests for the methods and properties. But here's a little hint: you need some way to track the balance, but the balance can only be altered by other methods. It isn't visible to the outside world. Do you know how to hide a class property?

# Short answers
There's some reading required for these ones! Make sure you do them.

# Going Beyond
We've been at Marcy for months now, and you've learned so much already. It's incredible! We're still going to be explaining a lot and teaching you a ton more, but it's time we work on making you "Auto-Didacts." That just means "self-taught learners." And luckily, that simply boils down to figuring out what you *don't* know, and taking the steps to fill in those gaps.

## What *should* you know
This is a crucial question for self learning. It's why note taking is so important in lectures. You need to go back over the topics covered and really be honest with yourself about what you understand.

A good way to test that is to try explaining a topic to someone. If you can't explain it simply, you probably don't know it.

Another strategy is to take examples and problems, and then modify them. So if we asked you to make a `Car` class, you'd make a `Bike` class. If you know how to make a closure that makes a number go up, make a closure that adds things to a list. Then removes them. Then modifies them. You get the idea. Start with something you know, and keep modifying it until you *don't*. Then figure it out!

## A cheat sheet of topics
To be friendly, here's the broad strokes of everything we covered this week:
- Closures
- Closures that specifically return functions
- Factory Functions
- this
- Factory functions with this/closures
- `new`
- Classes
- Private class properties
- Private class methods

Do you understand exactly how those all work? If the answer to that is "no" for any one of them, then you know where to start.

## What's coming up
Now in addition to solidifying knowledge (which is arguably more important here), we should also be thinking about the future. What's coming up? Luckily, this naturally comes up just by Googling and talking to ChatGPT. You'll stumble into related topics. Research those a little bit to help bring clarity.

However, you're enrolled in a school, so "what are we learning next lesson?" is not hypothetical. I'll tell you the topics! After you're sure you understand everything we did this week, take some time to research these:

- Class properties/methods vs instance properties/methods
- the static keyword
- inheritance
- the extends keyword
- why is `this` so weird?
- What are class getters/setters
- Why people have strong opinions against getters/setters

## beyond.js
We have no tests for anything in this file, but we want to see you practice. Write code, write comments, ask questions, then answer them. Do whatever you feel will help you, but do it in this file so we can see.

This is not just a light assignment to give you free time. This assignment is dipping your toe into the pool of self learning and seeing how it feels. Companies want Jrs. who are self reliant. People who can be trusted to take responsibility for understanding something. And like every skill, that takes practice.

So let's start now!
